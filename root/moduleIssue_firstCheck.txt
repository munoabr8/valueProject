In Maven, both <dependencyManagement> and <dependencies> are important elements
used in the Project Object Model (POM) to manage dependencies, but they serve
different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a comparison and
contrast of these two elements:

1. <dependencyManagement>:

Purpose: <dependencyManagement> is used to centralize the management of
dependency versions within a project or a parent POM. It allows you to define
the versions of dependencies in one place and then reference those versions in
the <dependencies> section or in child projects.

Location: It is typically defined in the parent POM or in the current POM where
you want to centralize the version management.

Example:

xml

<dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
<artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
<version>1.7.32</version>
</dependency>
<!-- Other dependencies with specified versions -->
</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

Usage: In the <dependencies> section of your POM or child POMs, you can
reference these dependencies without specifying the version. Maven will
automatically use the version defined in <dependencyManagement>.

2. <dependencies>:

Purpose: <dependencies> is used to declare the actual dependencies your project
relies on. You specify the dependencies here along with their group IDs,
artifact IDs, and optionally their versions.

Location: <dependencies> is typically defined in your project's POM file to
list the direct dependencies for that specific project.

Example:

xml

<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
<artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
<version>1.7.32</version>
</dependency>
<!-- Other direct dependencies -->
</dependencies>

Usage: This section contains the actual dependencies required for your project,
and you must specify the versions here if they are not managed in
<dependencyManagement>.

Comparison and Contrast:

<dependencyManagement> is used for centralizing and managing versions, while
<dependencies> is used for specifying the actual dependencies.
<dependencyManagement> is often used in parent POMs to provide version
management for child projects, while <dependencies> is used in individual
project POMs.
When a version is specified in <dependencyManagement>, it can be omitted in the
<dependencies> section, and Maven will use the version defined in
<dependencyManagement.
<dependencyManagement> is a way to provide a common version for a dependency
across multiple projects, ensuring consistency.
<dependencies> lists the actual dependencies required for a specific project
and is where you specify the direct dependencies for that project.
In <dependencies>, you can also specify exclusions, scopes, and other
attributes specific to the individual dependencies.

In summary, <dependencyManagement> is about centralizing and managing
dependency versions, while <dependencies> is about declaring the actual
dependencies needed for a specific project. They work together to provide a
clean and consistent way to manage dependencies in Maven projects.
